# Neuron Bot

_This project is a part of series of projects, **Neural** for WCHL 2025, meant to make the ICP DAO capabilities accessible to organizations outside ICP. The goal is to establish ICP as the de-facto DAO platform for any needs._

Voting on SNS proposals, Stake-aware Access Controls, Enhanced Community Collaboration, all through Discord now!

This project enables seamless, secure, and privacy-conscious voting on Internet Computer’s SNS (Service Nervous System) proposals directly within Discord. It leverages Internet Identity, VetKeys and TEEs to make the entire user-flow completely secure. Designed with extensibility in mind, the system also lays the foundation for advanced community features such as stake-aware access control and enhanced governance workflows — turning Discord into a robust platform for decentralized decision-making and engagement.

## How does it work?

- Login through Internet Identity.
- Add the ephemeral principal as a Hot Key for your neurons.
- And you're done!

## Commands Supported

- `/display_login_message`: Displays a message with a button for users to Authenticate themselves
- `/print_proposal sns=`: Lets you print the last proposal of any SNS by name (used for demo)

_More commands to be added as we go on with the project_

## Architecture

The project has 3 components:
- **Registry Canister:** This canister is a clone of the Encrypted Maps canister. It stores the encrypted User Identity data, and verifies the TEE Attestations through a handshake process for access to encrypted values.
- **Proxy Agent:** The off-chain component responsible for establishing websocket communication with Discord servers. Also securely handles the storage of user identity. It runs in a Nitro TEE Enclave for trust.
- **Frontend Canister**

_Note: TEEs have been avoided for this hackathon project because of the high costs. In production, we'll use OracleKit's [nitro-tee-kit](https://github.com/OracleKit/nitro-tee-kit) and [nitro-tee-attestation](https://github.com/OracleKit/nitro-tee-attestation)_

The project uses the following external components:
- **SNS Aggregator:** For up-to-date SNS data
- **Internet Identity:** For authentication

### Technical Workflow

- User clicks the "Login" button on Discord.
- The interaction is received by `Proxy Agent`, which send a ephemeral response with a unique login link.
- The link takes the user to a login page through the `Frontend` canister.
- User logins through Internet Identity.
- Private Key of the ephemeral II principal and delegation information, gets encrypted and stored in the `Registry` canister
- Whenever user tries to interact with proposals, `Proxy Agent` undergoes handshake for TEE verification with `Registry` canister.
- It then gets the corresponding II data and carries the interaction on behalf of the user.

## Security

The ephemeral Internet Identity principal, it's private keys and the delegation data are all encrypted and stored in the Registry Canister using VetKeys on ICP. The `Registry Canister` grants access to the keys, only to the `Proxy Agent` by verifying the Nitro TEE Attestations, and matching the running image hash to the last release. This ensures the sensitive data is not exposed in any way.

## Deployed Canisters
- Frontend Canister: [bv6mc-zqaaa-aaaam-aenqa-cai](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/canister/bv6mc-zqaaa-aaaam-aenqa-cai)
- Registry Canister: [bs7kw-uiaaa-aaaam-aenqq-cai](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/canister/bs7kw-uiaaa-aaaam-aenqq-cai)

## Local Setup

Requirements:
- Bash shell
- Node.js (>=16.0.0) with pnpm
- Rust

Create a `.env` file with the following contents:
```bash
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=
DISCORD_BOT_CLIENT_ID=
FRONTEND_URL=
VITE_DISCORD_PROXY_HOSTNAME=http://localhost:3000
REGISTRY_CANISTER_ICP_NETWORK_URL=http://localhost:4943
```
Fill your Discord bot client id and token, and the frontend url (either deployed asset canister or vite local instance url).

Then create a `src/discord-proxy/private-key.json` file with the output of the following script:
```js
import { Ed25519KeyIdentity } from '@dfinity/identity';
console.log(JSON.stringify(Ed25519KeyIdentity.generate().toJSON()))
```
This creates a random identity for the `discord-proxy` component, to securely access VetKeys.

To start the project locally, run:
```bash 
dfx start --background --clean
npm run setup
npm run deploy
npm run start:proxy
```

## About Neural

Neural is a larger project that aims to reimagine Decentralized Governance for everyone. In chains outside ICP ecosystem like Ethereum, Solana, Aptos, because of the high gas costs and slow transactions, the DAO ecosystem is mostly on centralized voting and governance apps. This creates a paradox where DAOs that came with the promise of decentralization are themselves centralized.

The vision of Neural is to use ICP to provide a chain-agnostic DAO Governance Layer, that is not gas-heavy yet on-chain and auditable, and close to where the people actually are - Discord, Telegram and Discourse Forums. With Neural, every DAO across all chains can become truly on-chain just at a fraction of the current cost of providers. This will make ICP the heart of DAOs, in-turn entire Web3 ecosystem.

## Roadmap
### Neuron Bot - Governance where the people are
A Discord Bot that allows governance for ICP SNS DAOs from within the Discord app. The architecture could be extended to other centralized communication platforms like Telegram, Discourse Forums, etc and bring the governance layer closer to where people talk.

### Neural Hub
The cross-chain governance layer for DAOs that works across Ethereum, Solana, ICP and Aptos. Completely on-chain and auditable voting and proposals with native chain support.
